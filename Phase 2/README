Phase 2 — Theory (README.md)
Scope and Purpose

Phase 2 contains theory-only materials.
This phase exists to explore assumptions, stress limits, edge cases, and conceptual behavior without authorizing execution.

Phase 2 answers the question:

“If someone were to attempt this, what breaks, what holds, and under what constraints?”

It does not answer:

“How do we build this?”
“How much does it cost?”
“What vendor should do it?”

Those questions are explicitly out of scope.

Phase Separation (Non-Negotiable)

Phase 2 is legally and operationally separate from Phase 0 and Phase 1.

Phase	Purpose	Execution Allowed
Phase 0	Permission to exist	❌ No
Phase 1	Permission to test	❌ No
Phase 2	Theory, stress, reasoning	❌ No
Phase 3	Execution & money	✅ With license

Reading Phase 2 does not expand rights granted by Phase 0 or Phase 1.

License Governing Phase 2

All Phase 2 materials are governed by the Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0).

Key rule, stated plainly:

Phase 2 may be read, discussed, critiqued, and reasoned about —
but not executed — without a separate execution license defined in Phase 3.

If someone wants to build, test, simulate, propose, fund, or deploy anything derived from Phase 2, they must first obtain an execution license.

The full license text is included as LICENSE_TEL-1.0.md.

What Phase 2 Includes

Typical Phase 2 materials may include:

Assumption stress tests

Failure-mode extremes

Constraint violations

Comparative archetypes

Boundary analysis

Long-tail risk exploration

These materials are intentionally allowed to be incomplete, speculative, or wrong. That is the point.

What Phase 2 Explicitly Does NOT Do

Phase 2 does not:

Authorize hardware builds

Provide construction instructions

Support proposals or bids

Provide validated performance claims

Offer cost, ROI, or schedule guarantees

If someone treats Phase 2 as executable guidance, that is a license violation, not a misunderstanding.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 is a thinking space, not a build space. You can read it, argue with it, and learn from it — but you cannot use it to make real-world systems without a separate execution license defined in Phase 3.

LICENSE_TEL-1.0.md
Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0)
1. Purpose

This license governs access to and use of theory-only materials contained in the Phase 2 section of this repository (“Theory Materials”).

These materials are provided solely for reading, reasoning, critique, and conceptual exploration.

This is not an open-source license.

2. Definitions

Theory Materials
All documents, diagrams, calculations, text, and reasoning contained in Phase 2.

Execution
Any action that applies Theory Materials to real-world activity, including but not limited to: building, prototyping, testing, simulating, manufacturing, deploying, integrating, proposing, contracting, funding, or operational use.

Licensee
Any individual or entity accessing or using the Theory Materials.

3. Permitted Uses (Free)

The following uses are permitted without payment or additional permission:

Reading and reviewing the Theory Materials

Private reasoning and internal discussion

Academic or informal critique

Independent verification of logic or math

High-level conceptual reference without implementation

These uses do not authorize execution.

4. Prohibited Uses Without Execution License

The following are explicitly prohibited without a separate execution license:

Building or prototyping

Laboratory or field testing

Simulation for implementation purposes

Use in proposals, bids, grants, or contracts

Integration into other systems or designs

Commercial or government deployment

Derivative works intended for execution

Intent is irrelevant. Outcome controls.

5. Execution License Requirement

Any execution requires a separate Execution License obtained prior to execution.

Base execution license fee: $5,000 USD

Additional scope, terms, and royalties negotiated separately

Execution licenses are granted in writing only

Possession of Phase 0 or Phase 1 materials does not waive this requirement.

6. Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are governed by their own licenses

Phase 2 does not modify Phase 0 / Phase 1 rights

Each phase is legally independent

7. No Warranty

THE THEORY MATERIALS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

No claim is made that the materials are correct, complete, safe, feasible, or suitable for any purpose.

8. Limitation of Liability

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR OR LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM USE OR MISUSE OF THE THEORY MATERIALS.

9. Termination

This license terminates automatically upon violation.
All rights immediately cease.

10. Acceptance

Accessing or using the Theory Materials constitutes acceptance of this license.

If you do not agree, do not access the materials.
