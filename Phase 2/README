Phase 2 — Theory (README.md)
Scope and Purpose

Phase 2 contains theory-only materials.
This phase exists to explore assumptions, stress limits, edge cases, and conceptual behavior without authorizing execution.

Phase 2 answers the question:

“If someone were to attempt this, what breaks, what holds, and under what constraints?”

It does not answer:

“How do we build this?”
“How much does it cost?”
“What vendor should do it?”

Those questions are explicitly out of scope.

Phase Separation (Non-Negotiable)

Phase 2 is legally and operationally separate from Phase 0 and Phase 1.

Phase	Purpose	Execution Allowed
Phase 0	Permission to exist	❌ No
Phase 1	Permission to test	❌ No
Phase 2	Theory, stress, reasoning	❌ No
Phase 3	Execution & money	✅ With license

Reading Phase 2 does not expand rights granted by Phase 0 or Phase 1.

License Governing Phase 2

All Phase 2 materials are governed by the Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0).

Key rule, stated plainly:

Phase 2 may be read, discussed, critiqued, and reasoned about —
but not executed — without a separate execution license defined in Phase 3.

If someone wants to build, test, simulate, propose, fund, or deploy anything derived from Phase 2, they must first obtain an execution license.

The full license text is included as LICENSE_TEL-1.0.md.

What Phase 2 Includes

Typical Phase 2 materials may include:

Assumption stress tests

Failure-mode extremes

Constraint violations

Comparative archetypes

Boundary analysis

Long-tail risk exploration

These materials are intentionally allowed to be incomplete, speculative, or wrong. That is the point.

What Phase 2 Explicitly Does NOT Do

Phase 2 does not:

Authorize hardware builds

Provide construction instructions

Support proposals or bids

Provide validated performance claims

Offer cost, ROI, or schedule guarantees

If someone treats Phase 2 as executable guidance, that is a license violation, not a misunderstanding.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 is a thinking space, not a build space. You can read it, argue with it, and learn from it — but you cannot use it to make real-world systems without a separate execution license defined in Phase 3.
