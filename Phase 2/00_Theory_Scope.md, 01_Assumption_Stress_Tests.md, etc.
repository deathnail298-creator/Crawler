Phase 2 — Theory Scope
Purpose

This document defines what Phase 2 is and is not.

Phase 2 exists to explore reasoning space, constraint pressure, and failure boundaries without authorizing execution.

It is explicitly a thinking layer, not a design, build, or test layer.

What Phase 2 Covers

Phase 2 may include:

Conceptual behavior under stress

Assumption fragility

Failure extremes and edge cases

Constraint violations

Comparative reasoning against adjacent archetypes

Boundary analysis between phases

Accuracy is not guaranteed. Completeness is not required.

What Phase 2 Does Not Do

Phase 2 does not:

Specify build steps

Define materials or dimensions

Provide validated performance claims

Authorize simulation for implementation

Support proposals, bids, or funding requests

Any attempt to treat Phase 2 as executable guidance violates the license.

Phase Relationship

Phase 2:

Does not modify Phase 0 or Phase 1

Does not grant execution rights

Is legally independent

Execution authority exists only in Phase 3 with a separate license.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 is where ideas are stressed and broken on paper so mistakes don’t get made in hardware. It is for thinking, not building.

01_Assumption_Stress_Tests.md
Assumption Stress Tests
Purpose

This document identifies key assumptions and examines how they fail under pressure.

The goal is not to prove assumptions correct, but to understand how wrong they can be before the system becomes invalid.

Assumption Categories

Typical assumption classes examined here include:

Environmental conditions

Operational timelines

Human interaction expectations

Passive behavior consistency

Maintenance neglect tolerance

Assumptions are treated as fragile by default.

Stress Method

Each assumption is conceptually stressed by asking:

What if this is partially wrong?

What if it degrades slowly?

What if it fails intermittently?

What if it fails silently?

No simulations or tests are authorized or implied.

Interpretation Rules

Breaking an assumption does not kill the concept by default

Cascading failures matter more than single-point breaks

Graceful degradation is more important than nominal performance

Plain-English Summary

This file exists to poke holes in comfortable assumptions before reality does it for free.

02_Failure_Extremes.md
Failure Extremes
Purpose

This document explores worst-case conceptual failures, not likely failures.

It intentionally examines scenarios beyond normal engineering margins.

Failure Types Considered

Conceptual extremes may include:

Total loss of function

Partial degradation over time

Environmental abuse beyond design intent

Complete neglect or abandonment

Incorrect placement or misuse

No attempt is made to prevent all failures.

Acceptable vs Unacceptable Failure

Phase 2 distinguishes between:

Acceptable failure: system becomes ineffective but non-harmful

Unacceptable failure: system causes damage, risk, or cascading dependency

Only unacceptable failures invalidate the concept.

Design Implication Rule

If a failure requires:

Active intervention

Complex recovery

Tight tolerances

…it is flagged as incompatible with the core philosophy.

Plain-English Summary

This document asks, “How badly can this go wrong?” and checks whether the answer is still tolerable.

03_Constraint_Violations.md
Constraint Violations
Purpose

This document examines what happens when stated constraints are violated.

Constraints are treated as real, not aspirational.

Constraint Categories

Typical constraints examined include:

Power availability

Mass and volume limits

Operational simplicity

Environmental exposure

Human attention and maintenance

Violations are assumed to be accidental, not malicious.

Violation Analysis

For each constraint, the analysis asks:

What breaks first?

Does failure propagate?

Does recovery require coordination?

Does violation cause hidden coupling?

Constraints that fail gracefully are preferred.

Phase Discipline Note

This document does not propose fixes.
It only records consequences.

Plain-English Summary

This file shows what happens when reality ignores the rules and checks whether the system survives anyway.

04_Comparative_Archetypes.md
Comparative Archetypes
Purpose

This document compares the concept against adjacent or alternative archetypes at a reasoning level only.

No performance claims are made.

Comparison Axes

Conceptual comparisons may include:

Passive vs active approaches

Centralized vs distributed behavior

Fragile vs sacrificial infrastructure

Optimized vs tolerant systems

Comparisons are qualitative, not quantitative.

Interpretation Rules

“Different” does not mean “better”

Tradeoffs are more important than superiority

Simpler systems are judged by failure behavior, not efficiency

Non-Claim Boundary

This document does not claim:

Superiority

Replacement of existing systems

Universal applicability

Plain-English Summary

This file explains how the idea fits into the ecosystem without claiming it should replace anything.

05_Long-Tail_Risks.md
Long-Tail Risks
Purpose

This document captures low-probability, high-impact conceptual risks.

These risks are often ignored because they are inconvenient or hard to quantify.

Risk Types Considered

Examples include:

Rare environmental conditions

Organizational misuse

Incorrect mental models by operators

Policy or certification friction

Long-duration degradation effects

Likelihood estimates are intentionally avoided.

Handling Philosophy

Long-tail risks are:

Documented, not dismissed

Accepted, not eliminated

Managed through simplicity, not control

Phase Boundary

Mitigation strategies are not defined here.
That belongs to execution planning, not theory.

Plain-English Summary

This file records the uncomfortable risks that don’t show up in happy-path thinking.

06_Phase_Boundary_Analysis.md
Phase Boundary Analysis
Purpose

This document defines where Phase 2 must stop and Phase 3 would begin.

It prevents theory creep into execution.

Phase 2 Hard Stops

Phase 2 ends before:

Material selection

Geometry finalization

Cost estimation

Schedule definition

Performance guarantees

Crossing these lines requires Phase 3 authorization.

Hand-off Criteria (Conceptual Only)

Phase 2 may conclude when:

Major assumptions are surfaced

Failure modes are understood

Constraints are respected

No hidden execution dependencies remain

These are readiness indicators, not approvals.

Legal Reminder

Phase 2 completion does not grant execution rights.

Execution authority exists only through a Phase 3 execution license.

Plain-English Summary

This file draws the line that keeps thinking from quietly turning into building.
