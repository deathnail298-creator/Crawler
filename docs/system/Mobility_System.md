Mobility System
Purpose of the Mobility System

The mobility system exists to reposition the Crawler between adjacent surface areas so that multiple heating operations can be performed. Mobility is a supporting capability, not a primary mission function.

The system is designed for slow, deliberate movement rather than distance, speed, or efficiency.

Mobility Approach

The Crawler uses a mechanically simple mobility approach appropriate for early testing. This may include:

Tracks, wheels, or equivalent ground-contact mechanisms

Low-speed actuation with high tolerance for uneven or loose surfaces

The mobility system prioritizes robustness and predictability over precision control.

Movement Scope

Mobility is limited to:

Short-distance repositioning

Alignment over adjacent work areas

Minor corrective movements after heating cycles

Long-range traversal, navigation between distant sites, or terrain optimization are explicitly out of scope.

Control Characteristics

Movement is commanded using deterministic, rule-based logic. The system does not attempt:

Path optimization

Terrain classification

Adaptive locomotion strategies

If movement cannot be completed safely, the system is expected to stop and enter a safe or idle state.

Degradation and Failure Tolerance

Reduced mobility is considered an acceptable degraded condition. Even limited or partial movement may be sufficient to continue useful heating operations.

Complete loss of mobility does not automatically terminate usefulness if stationary heating remains possible and safe.

Mechanical Simplicity

The mobility system avoids:

Tight mechanical tolerances

Precision steering requirements

Complex suspension or articulation

This simplicity supports survivability during testing and ease of modification.

Phase Discipline

This mobility description applies to Phase 0 conceptual definition and Phase 1 testing only. It does not imply validated traction performance, terrain coverage capability, or operational endurance.

Plain-English Summary

The Crawler’s mobility system lets it move slowly from one spot to another so it can heat more than one area. It is built to be simple and durable, not fast or precise, and it stops if movement becomes unsafe. Even if movement is reduced or lost, the machine can still be useful by heating the ground where it sits.
