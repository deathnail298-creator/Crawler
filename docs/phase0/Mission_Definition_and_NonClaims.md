Mission Definition and Non-Claims
Mission Definition

The mission of the Crawler is to reduce dust lofting by converting loose regolith into a more cohesive surface through localized heating. The system accomplishes this by sintering surface material into a hardened layer that is less likely to become airborne when later disturbed.

The Crawler’s mission is limited to surface dust stabilization. It does not attempt to reshape terrain, excavate material, or construct load-bearing infrastructure.

Intended Role

Within its intended scope, the Crawler serves as a pre-infrastructure surface conditioning tool. It is designed to operate before, or independently of, other surface assets and to improve local surface conditions in a limited area through repeated, localized action.

The system is designed to operate slowly and deliberately, favoring reliability and simplicity over speed or coverage.

Explicit Non-Claims

The Crawler explicitly does not claim to be:

A permanent landing pad system

A construction or civil-engineering platform

An excavation, grading, or leveling system

A science instrument or research payload

An AI-driven or self-planning rover

A deployment-ready or flight-qualified system

Any interpretation of the Crawler beyond dust stabilization through localized heating is outside the scope of Phase 0.

Operational Boundaries

The Crawler does not autonomously determine mission objectives, site selection, or operational priorities. These decisions are defined externally by mission operators or test planners.

Onboard logic is limited to local movement decisions, obstacle handling, and execution of heating cycles within assigned zones.

Phase Discipline

All descriptions in this document apply strictly to Phase 0 conceptual definition. No claims are made regarding operational effectiveness, endurance, coverage rate, or long-term performance.

Any capability not explicitly validated during Phase 1 testing remains an assumption only.

Plain-English Summary

The Crawler’s job is to reduce dust by heating loose regolith until it hardens into a surface that is less likely to kick up particles. It is meant to prepare small areas before other systems arrive, not to build structures, level terrain, or act as a smart rover. People decide where it operates, and anything beyond basic dust stabilization through heating is explicitly out of scope at this stage.
