Phase 0 Assumptions
Purpose of Assumptions

This document identifies the technical and operational assumptions that underlie the Crawler concept at Phase 0. These assumptions are explicitly acknowledged as unvalidated and are not treated as demonstrated capabilities.

The purpose of stating these assumptions is to clearly define what must be tested in Phase 1 and to prevent implied guarantees.

Heating and Sintering Assumptions

Loose regolith can be sintered into a cohesive surface layer through localized resistive heating.

Sintering can be achieved at the surface without requiring excavation or material handling.

A sintered layer of limited depth is sufficient to reduce dust lofting relative to untreated regolith.

These assumptions define the core technical hypothesis of the system.

Thermal Management Assumptions

Thermal isolation methods can protect internal components from heater-generated temperatures.

Heat can be directed primarily into surface material without causing unsafe internal conditions.

Thermal behavior during heating cycles is predictable enough to be managed conservatively.

These assumptions must be validated before any claims of safe operation can be made.

Power and Energy Assumptions

Onboard power generation and storage can support intermittent heating cycles.

Energy availability is sufficient to allow heating, idle, and pause states without unsafe depletion.

Conservative power management is adequate to prevent forced operation under low-energy conditions.

Power feasibility is treated as a testable assumption, not a guaranteed capability.

Mobility and Positioning Assumptions

Limited mobility is sufficient to reposition the system between adjacent work areas.

Precise positioning is not required for effective dust stabilization.

Loss or reduction of mobility does not eliminate the usefulness of stationary heating.

Mobility is assumed to be beneficial but not essential.

Control and Navigation Assumptions

Deterministic, rule-based logic is sufficient for bounded local movement.

The system can recognize stalled or unsafe states without complex perception or learning.

Human oversight can resolve conditions that onboard logic does not handle.

No assumptions are made regarding autonomous planning or optimization.

Environmental Variability Assumptions

Surface material properties may vary within expected bounds.

The system can tolerate variability through slow operation and repeated heating cycles.

Unexpected surface behavior does not require real-time adaptive control to remain safe.

Environmental uncertainty is acknowledged rather than ignored.

Phase Discipline

All assumptions listed here apply strictly to Phase 0. None are treated as validated outcomes, and none imply operational readiness.

Validation or rejection of these assumptions is the sole purpose of Phase 1 testing.

Plain-English Summary

The Crawler is based on the idea that loose dust can be hardened by heating it, that the machine can protect itself from that heat, and that simple movement and control are enough to do the job. It assumes that power, mobility, and surface conditions will be good enough for slow, careful operation, even if things vary or degrade. None of these ideas are proven yet, and Phase 1 exists specifically to test whether they are actually true.
