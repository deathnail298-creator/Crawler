Phase 0 Success Criteria
Purpose of Phase 0 Success Criteria

Phase 0 success criteria define the conditions under which the Crawler concept is considered sufficiently coherent, bounded, and credible to justify controlled testing. These criteria do not measure performance or effectiveness; they assess conceptual readiness only.

Meeting these criteria grants permission to proceed to Phase 1 testing.

Conceptual Coherence

Phase 0 is successful if:

The mission definition is clear and narrowly scoped

The system’s primary function is unambiguous

Architectural elements support the stated mission without contradiction

The concept must make internal sense without relying on future capabilities.

Boundary Clarity

Phase 0 is successful if:

System responsibilities are clearly separated from human decision-making

Explicit non-claims prevent unintended scope expansion

No implied autonomy, deployment, or infrastructure dependency exists

Boundaries must be enforceable through design, not intention.

Technical Plausibility

Phase 0 is successful if:

Required subsystems rely on known or mature technologies

No component requires speculative physics or unavailable materials

Assumptions are technically reasonable and explicitly stated

Plausibility is assessed qualitatively, not through testing.

Failure Containment

Phase 0 is successful if:

Likely failure modes are identified

Failures are non-catastrophic by design

Degraded operation remains useful within scope

The system must fail safely and predictably.

Testability

Phase 0 is successful if:

Key assumptions can be isolated and tested independently

Phase 1 test modules can be clearly defined

Pass/fail outcomes can be determined without ambiguity

If the concept cannot be tested cleanly, it does not advance.

Phase Discipline

Phase 0 success does not imply:

Validated performance

Environmental survivability

Operational readiness

Deployment suitability

All such claims remain out of scope until later phases.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 0 succeeds if the Crawler idea makes sense, stays within clear limits, and does not depend on unrealistic technology or hidden assumptions. The design must be simple, fail safely, and have a clear path to being tested without claiming it already works. If the concept is coherent and testable, it earns the right to move on to Phase 1.
