Executive / Contractor Appendix
Purpose

This appendix provides high-level planning estimates only for organizations evaluating whether to advance the Crawler beyond Phase 1. The figures below are order-of-magnitude estimates, not detailed budgets or contractual commitments, and are intended solely to support early go/no-go decision-making.

No assumptions are made about mission environment, production scale, or integration context.

Phase 1 to Commercialization — Cost Estimate

Estimated total cost (Phase 1 completion to first commercial-ready unit):
$6–12 million USD

This estimate assumes:

Successful Phase 1 outcomes

Engineering refinement, not fundamental redesign

Conventional materials and manufacturing methods

No flight qualification or mission-specific hardening included

Phase 1 to Commercialization — Time Estimate

Estimated time (Phase 1 completion to commercial-ready unit):
24–36 months

This estimate assumes:

Continuous funding

No major assumption invalidation

Standard engineering iteration cycles

Parallel development of hardware refinement and manufacturing readiness

Estimated Price per Fabricated Unit

Estimated unit price (low-volume commercial production):
$250k–$500k per unit

This estimate assumes:

Low to moderate production volume

No mission-specific customization

Ground or analog-environment deployment

Excludes launch, integration, or operational support costs

Important Scope Notes

These estimates do not include launch services, mission integration, or operational staffing.

These figures do not assume a specific planetary body or operating environment.

Pricing reflects fabrication cost plus commercial margin, not internal R&D recovery.

Any expansion beyond dust stabilization or Phase 1–validated behavior will materially change these numbers.

Plain-English Summary

If Phase 1 succeeds, taking the Crawler to a sellable product would likely cost several million dollars and take a few years of engineering work. Each unit would be priced in the hundreds of thousands of dollars depending on production scale. These numbers are meant to help executives decide whether the idea is worth pursuing further, not to serve as a final budget.
