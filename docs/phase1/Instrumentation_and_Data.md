Instrumentation and Data
Purpose of Instrumentation

Instrumentation in Phase 1 exists to produce clear, defensible evidence about whether Phase 0 assumptions hold. Measurements are selected to support pass/fail decisions for each test module, not to optimize performance or characterize long-term behavior.

Instrumentation is intentionally simple, observable, and sufficient for early validation.

Measurement Philosophy

Phase 1 instrumentation follows three principles:

Measure only what is required to validate assumptions

Prefer direct measurements over inferred metrics

Accept coarse resolution if it reliably indicates success or failure

High-precision or flight-grade instrumentation is explicitly out of scope.

Thermal Measurements

Thermal instrumentation is used to assess both heating effectiveness and internal protection.

Measured parameters include:

Heater surface temperature

Temperature at the regolith interface

Internal component temperatures near sensitive hardware

Temperature gradients across isolation boundaries

These measurements support evaluation of sintering feasibility and thermal safety.

Power and Energy Measurements

Power instrumentation is used to evaluate energy feasibility during heating and movement cycles.

Measured parameters include:

Instantaneous power draw during heating

Energy consumed per heating cycle

State of charge before and after operation

Power draw during idle or paused states

These measurements determine whether energy use can be managed safely during testing.

Mobility and Mechanical Observations

Mobility instrumentation focuses on functional behavior rather than precision performance.

Observed parameters include:

Ability to initiate and complete commanded movements

Changes in movement capability after thermal exposure

Mechanical degradation or binding

Quantitative motion tracking is optional; qualitative observation is acceptable if it clearly indicates functional change.

Control and Logic Observations

Control logic behavior is evaluated through state observation rather than internal algorithm analysis.

Observed parameters include:

Detection of stalled or blocked states

Transitions between active, paused, and idle states

Absence of unrecoverable control loops

Logging or external monitoring may be used to confirm state transitions.

Surface and Dust Observations

Surface condition and dust behavior are assessed using visual and comparative methods.

Observed parameters include:

Presence and continuity of sintered surface layers

Surface cracking or fragmentation after cooling

Relative dust movement or plume size when disturbed

These observations support qualitative and comparative evaluation of dust reduction.

Data Handling and Interpretation

Data collected during Phase 1 is used to:

Support pass/fail determinations for each test module

Identify failure modes or safety limits

Inform whether Phase 1 exit criteria are met

No attempt is made to extrapolate results to operational performance, scaling, or mission outcomes.

Phase Discipline

All instrumentation and data usage described here apply strictly to Phase 1 testing. Data is not treated as evidence of readiness for deployment, durability, or long-term operation.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 uses basic sensors and observations to check whether the Crawler heats dust as expected, protects itself from heat, manages power safely, moves when needed, and behaves predictably. The measurements are simple on purpose and are only meant to support clear pass or fail decisions for each test. The data is used to decide whether the idea works well enough to keep studying, not to claim real-world readiness.
