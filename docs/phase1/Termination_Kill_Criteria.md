Phase 1 Termination (Kill) Criteria
Purpose of Termination Criteria

Termination criteria define the conditions under which Phase 1 testing is halted early. These criteria exist to prevent continued effort on a concept that fails to meet its fundamental assumptions or presents unacceptable safety or feasibility risks.

Stopping early is considered a valid and successful outcome if it clearly invalidates a core assumption.

Kill Criteria Philosophy

Phase 1 kill criteria are intentionally conservative and focused on concept validity, not performance optimization. If a foundational assumption cannot be demonstrated under controlled conditions, continued testing is not justified.

Termination criteria are based on clear observations rather than marginal performance shortfalls.

KC-1: Failure to Sinter Regolith

Phase 1 testing is terminated if:

Repeated heating cycles fail to produce a cohesive sintered surface layer

Surface material remains loose or unconsolidated after cooling

Heating produces uncontrolled melting or material behavior inconsistent with dust stabilization

Failure to sinter invalidates the core premise of the system.

KC-2: Unsafe Internal Thermal Behavior

Phase 1 testing is terminated if:

Internal component temperatures exceed survivable limits

Thermal isolation cannot prevent unsafe heat transfer

Heating cannot be controlled without risking internal damage

Inability to manage heat safely invalidates continued testing.

KC-3: Unsustainable Power Demand

Phase 1 testing is terminated if:

Heating cycles consistently force unsafe power depletion

Reduced duty cycles do not restore energy balance

Power availability cannot support even limited testing without risk

Power infeasibility invalidates practical testing.

KC-4: Loss of Meaningful Mobility

Phase 1 testing is terminated if:

The system cannot reposition itself at least minimally

Mobility loss prevents repeated heating operations

Degraded movement cannot be accommodated safely

While mobility is not essential, total inability to reposition may invalidate test objectives.

KC-5: Control Logic Deadlock or Unsafe States

Phase 1 testing is terminated if:

Control logic enters unrecoverable loops

The system cannot transition to safe or idle states

Unsafe behavior persists despite conservative control rules

Predictable and safe behavior is required for continued testing.

Termination Procedure

If any kill criterion is met:

Active testing is halted

The system is placed in a safe state if possible

Test data and observations are recorded

Phase 1 outcomes are documented as a negative or partial result

Termination does not imply failure of execution, only invalidation of assumptions.

Phase Discipline

Termination criteria apply strictly to Phase 1 testing. They do not imply judgments about future designs, alternative approaches, or different operating conditions.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 testing stops if the Crawler cannot harden dust with heat, cannot protect itself from that heat, cannot manage power safely, cannot move enough to keep testing, or behaves unpredictably. These stop conditions exist to avoid wasting time or taking unnecessary risks when a core idea does not work. Ending testing early is an acceptable outcome if it clearly shows the concept is not viable.
