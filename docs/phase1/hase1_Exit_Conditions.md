Phase 1 Exit Conditions
Purpose of Exit Conditions

Phase 1 exit conditions define what constitutes a completed Phase 1 effort, regardless of outcome. These conditions ensure that Phase 1 concludes with a clear technical determination rather than drifting into extended experimentation or implicit next phases.

Exit conditions apply whether results are positive, negative, or mixed.

Successful Phase 1 Exit

Phase 1 is considered successfully completed if:

All critical Phase 1 test modules have been executed or deliberately terminated

Core Phase 0 assumptions have been clearly validated or invalidated

Test outcomes are supported by observable data

No unresolved safety or control issues remain

A successful exit does not require all assumptions to be validated positively.

Partial or Negative Phase 1 Exit

Phase 1 is also considered complete if:

One or more kill criteria are triggered

Testing is halted due to failure of a core assumption

Results clearly indicate that the concept is not feasible under tested conditions

In these cases, Phase 1 still produces a valid outcome by reducing uncertainty and preventing further resource expenditure.

Documentation Requirements

At Phase 1 exit, the following must be documented:

Which assumptions were validated, invalidated, or remain inconclusive

Which test modules were completed or terminated

Any safety issues encountered

Rationale for proceeding, pausing, or stopping further work

Documentation is required regardless of outcome.

Phase Boundary Enforcement

Completion of Phase 1 does not grant permission to:

Deploy the system

Claim operational readiness

Optimize performance

Expand scope or autonomy

Any further activity beyond Phase 1 requires explicit re-scoping and authorization under a new phase.

Phase Discipline

Phase 1 exit conditions are intended to close the testing phase cleanly and deliberately. They prevent implicit continuation into later phases without explicit review and decision-making.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 ends when testing clearly shows which ideas work, which do not, and which still need more study. The phase is considered complete whether the results are good or bad, as long as the outcomes are clearly documented and understood. Finishing Phase 1 does not mean the system is ready to be used, only that a decision can be made about what to do next.
