Phase 1 Objectives
Purpose of Phase 1

Phase 1 exists to validate the core assumptions identified in Phase 0 through controlled testing. The goal is to reduce technical uncertainty and determine whether the Crawler concept is feasible enough to justify further investigation.

Phase 1 is explicitly limited to testing and validation, not optimization, deployment, or operational use.

Primary Objectives

The primary objectives of Phase 1 are to determine whether:

Localized heating can reliably sinter loose regolith into a cohesive surface layer.

Internal components can be protected from heater-generated temperatures.

Available power can support heating cycles without unsafe depletion.

The system can reposition itself sufficiently to perform repeated heating actions.

Simple, deterministic control logic can manage local movement and stalled states.

Sintered surfaces measurably reduce dust lofting compared to untreated regolith.

Each objective corresponds directly to an assumption identified in Phase 0.

Risk Reduction Focus

Phase 1 focuses on reducing the highest-risk uncertainties first. Priority is given to testing outcomes that would invalidate the concept entirely if unsuccessful, such as failure to sinter regolith or inability to manage internal heat.

Lower-risk or secondary behaviors are intentionally deferred.

Bounded Testing Philosophy

All Phase 1 objectives are pursued within bounded, controlled environments such as laboratory setups or analog test rigs. No objective requires field deployment, long-duration operation, or integration with external infrastructure.

Testing is designed to be repeatable, observable, and measurable.

Objective Success Framing

Success in Phase 1 is defined by clear pass/fail outcomes for each objective. Partial success, degraded performance, or negative results are considered valid outcomes if they clearly inform feasibility.

Phase 1 does not attempt to prove readiness for operational use.

Phase Discipline

Meeting Phase 1 objectives indicates that the concept is suitable for higher-fidelity testing only. It does not imply deployment readiness, environmental qualification, or mission integration.

Any capability not explicitly validated in Phase 1 remains an assumption.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 1 is meant to find out whether the main ideas behind the Crawler actually work when tested. It checks whether heating can harden dust, whether the machine can protect itself from that heat, whether power and movement are sufficient, and whether simple controls are enough to operate safely. The goal is to reduce uncertainty, not to prove the system is ready to be used in real missions.
